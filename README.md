# Amazon-Apparel-Recommendation-System
## Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced recommendation system for apparel products on Amazon. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system provides personalized recommendations to enhance the user shopping experience.

---

## Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Suggest products based on textual and categorical data.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec for feature extraction.
- **Integration with Amazon API**: Fetches real-time product data using Amazon's Product Advertising API.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a recommendation accuracy of 98% during testing.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data preprocessing and analysis
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `nltk` and `gensim` for NLP tasks
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization
- **API Integration**: Amazon Product Advertising API
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Product Descriptions**: Detailed textual information about apparel items.
- **User Ratings**: Customer feedback and ratings.
- **Product Categories**: Classification of products into various apparel categories.
